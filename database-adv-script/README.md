# SQL Join Queries

This directory contains advanced SQL queries that demonstrate different types of joins:

1. **INNER JOIN** between `bookings` and `users` to get bookings and the user who made them.
2. **LEFT JOIN** between `properties` and `reviews` to get all properties and any reviews, including properties without reviews.
3. **FULL OUTER JOIN** between `users` and `bookings` to get all users and all bookings, even if there's no link between them.
